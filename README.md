# Pomodoro

[Pomodoro project](https://kynki7.github.io/calculator/) for The Odin Project.
Using HTMl, CSS and Javascript.

I get to recreate something I use a lot! I often find online pomodoro timers to be a bit not to my liking in terms of aesthetics. Though the functionality of them are mostly fine, I will hope to create a pomodoro timer which emphasises on a clean look.
