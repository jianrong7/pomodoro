# Pomodoro

[Pomodoro project](https://kynki7.github.io/pomodoro/) for The Odin Project.
Using HTMl, CSS and Javascript.

I get to recreate something I use a lot! I often find online pomodoro timers to be a bit not to my liking in terms of aesthetics. Though the functionality of them are mostly fine, I will hope to create a pomodoro timer which emphasises on a clean look.

## What I Learnt
- Slider HTML
- Retrieving values from a slider
- Improved familiarity with CSS Flexbox
- How to make visible and disappear using CSS and JS
- setInterval() and clearInterval() functions
- More familiar with flag logic, true / false
- parseInt function

## What I need to improve on
- Become more familiar with setInterval() and clearInterval() methods.
- Know when to create variables
